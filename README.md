    <summary><b>My personal website, built with a bunch of nonsense</b> (<i>modern frontend tools</i>)</summary>

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** — React framework with _neat things_:
  `SSR`, `API routes`, `optimized build system`
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** — Just a CSS framework i like.
  Makes CSS painless _sometimes_. I'm an engineer, not a coder.
- **[Upstash](https://upstash.com)** — Free Serverless Redis. Even tho i have
  home servers, _Free is always good_
- **[Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)** — Just some content SDK that
  transforms Markdown/MDX into type-safe JSON data, enabling structured content
  management with schema validation. Very neat tool actually.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** — like this platform for it's analytics,
  pleasant design, simplicity and strong free tier. However, doesn't really
  matter - github/gitlab/cloudflare/netlify/heroku, it's whatever.

## Running Locally

If you want to use it for some reason, here is how:

1. Clone repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:worthant/worthant.space.git
cd worthant.space
```

2. Create `.env` file similar to
   [`.env.example`](https://github.com/worthant/worthant.space/blob/main/.env.example).

3. Install dependencies and run the development server:

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use any dependency manager. Npm, pnpm, vite e.t.c. I just prefer bun,
> it's the fastest and safest. Trust me, i've tested :D

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```
